TODO : 
    - comments (add some + translate)
    - "scanner" script to scan a whole wally page
    - Error checking when cropping images, rather than just printing "All images have successfully been cropped" even when it's false 
    (altough it seems that the function doesn't even finishes when there's an exeception so this kinda works)
